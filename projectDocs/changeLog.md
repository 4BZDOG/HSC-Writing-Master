# HSC AI Evaluator - Change Log

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-30

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Ribbon Corner Flash**: Eliminated the square-corner artifact that flashed before the rounded corners settled when the writing progression ribbon (Editor header) animated. Added a `.clip-stable` utility that promotes rounded `overflow-hidden` surfaces to their own compositing layer up front, so the radius clip applies from the first frame. The Editor/Prompt headers and footers now also carry explicit matching corner radii as a fallback.
- **Cut-off Borders**: Removed the redundant `rounded-3xl overflow-hidden` wrapper around the Syllabus Reference panel that was clipping the inner accordion cards' rounded borders at the corners.
- **Project-wide Clip Stabilisation**: Extended `.clip-stable` to the remaining animated rounded `overflow-hidden` surfaces so they no longer flash square corners on entrance/transition — the Writing Metrics dashboard, Sample Answers and Marking Guide accordions, the gradient-header modals (Evaluation Result, Improvement Review, Outcome Detail, Command Term Guide, Sample Answer Generator), the Command Verb Hierarchy card, the Login card, and the idle/empty-state card.

### 🎨 Design

- **Border Consistency**: Normalised faint `border-white/5` outlines and dividers up to `border-white/10` across the main user-facing flow — the Prompt card footer and outcome chips, the Evaluation Result modal header, the Sample Answers dividers, the Breadcrumb bar, and the idle-state card. The dense admin/data-manager tools were intentionally left on their own consistent `/5` scale.
